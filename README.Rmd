# hector-timing-profile


The goal of hector-timing-profile is to save a copy of the scripts and results from a look at how long it takes to generate large ensembles of Hector runs. This is not a robust analysis. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())
```

Load the results produced from the `generate_ensemble.R` script, it is a file that contains information about how long it took to generate and ensemble of X size. 

```{r }
df <- read.csv(here::here("rslt.csv"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = df) + 
  geom_point(aes(log(size), elapsed/60)) + 
  labs(y = "Elapsed Run Time (min)", 
       x = "Log(Ensemble Size)", 
       title = "Hector Run Time")
```
As of July 2023 it takes an hour and 12 mins to generate an ensemble size 5,000.
